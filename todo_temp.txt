- * Deformable PPNet
- Orthagonality loss on prototypes to ensure diversity

If P is shape (num_protos, dimension, 1, 1), the loss is just:
P_s = P.squeeze(-1).squeeze(-1)
return P @ P.T

- More details on what these correspondences are
- Choose n samples that activate highly on a prototype, examine the prototypes of the other class (image/genetic) that also activate highjy.
